The **shadw.AI Cloud Development Kit (shadw CDK)** is an open-source edge computing development
framework to define Shadow Cloud Resources as code and provision it through Simpfi.AI.

It offers a high-level object-oriented abstraction to define Shadow resources imperatively using
the power of modern programming languages. Using the CDK’s library of
infrastructure constructs, you can easily encapsulate best practices in your
infrastructure definition and share it without worrying about boilerplate logic.

The CDK is available in the following languages:

* JavaScript, TypeScript ([Node.js ≥ 14.15.0](https://nodejs.org/download/release/latest-v14.x/))
  * We recommend using a version in [Active LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/)
